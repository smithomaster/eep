Well... it looks like I've attempted a challenge greater than I thought I would
take. I have decided to make DewHeart, a platformer game in 40 stages, where
the player, Jasper Dew, has to collect Red Bull cans in 40 stages in order to
take his resting heart rate from 0bpm at the start, to 40bpm at the end. Once
he reaches 40bpm, he is released from hospital.

Today, after finishing HeartBeast's Godot platformer game tutorial on YouTube, I
set out to start making sprites for the game, because really, I can't have the
game without sprites. Well... it turns out I'm not that good an artist. So I've
started working on making sprites, but this is gonna take a long time to draw
up, because obviously I've been working with a mouse (not the best tool for art)
and I'm not a really experienced artist. Hopefully I'll develop my skills in
pixel art here so its quicker in the future. Just making the first standing
model of Jasper (not yet finished) has taken a substantial amount of time - and
I'll need to make quite a few different variations on this for different
actions, which I'm sure will give me quite a big challenge. I want to try make
his hair flow in the air while he's running, and change depending on his
movement - not for any grand purpose, but I love his hair (hi Jasper ehehe).

All in all, even though I anticipate a great challenge ahead of me on this
journey, it should be great fun and I should have a cool game for my friends
and I at the end of it - but let's just say Jasper will probably be better by
then.
